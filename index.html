        <h3>About Us...</h3>
        <p><em>NVLT (pronounced “novelty”) is a New York City based rock band with heavy influences in funk, alternative rock, punk and R&B. The band consists of Anthony Vecere (Guitar), Tony McHale (Guitar/Bass), Mary Jardine (Vocals), Jason Markson (Guitar/Bass) and Tyler Katz (Drums). After meeting in college at SUNY Oneonta and inspired by its vibrant music scene, Anthony, Tony and Jason were motivated to start a band together and write songs of their own. Tyler and Mary joined shortly after, completing the band’s lineup and propelling the band’s songs to the next level!
        <br><br>
        NVLT’s major influences include Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Strokes, Kings of Leon, Still Woozy, John Mayer, Remi Wolf and many others.
